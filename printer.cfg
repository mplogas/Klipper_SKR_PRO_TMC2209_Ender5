# This file contains common pin mappings for the BigTreeTech SKR PRO.
# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# STM32F407 with a "32KiB bootloader".

# The "make flash" command does not work on the SKR PRO. Instead,
# after running "make", copy the generated "out/klipper.bin" file to a
# file named "firmware.bin" on an SD card and then restart the SKR PRO
# with that SD card.

# The configuration is very specific for a heavily modified Ender 5.
# By heavily modified I mean literally everything except the frame!
# And even that has been stiffed and improved with belt tensioners, linear rails and brackets
# So don't just blindly apply the config, but rather use it as inspiration
# to set up your printer.
