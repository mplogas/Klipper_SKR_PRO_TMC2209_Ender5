# Klipper configuration - BigTreeTech SKR Pro v1.1 with TMC 2209

The configuration file is fine-tuned for my heavily modified Ender 5 printer. And by heavily modified I mean litereally everything is customized on my printer, from the obvious things such as board, steppers, hotends, feeder or fans to mur subtly like Z-axis rod stabilization, linear rails, belt tensioners and frame brackets.

So, please use it as inspiration to set up your printer but just don't blindly apply this config to your specific setup. 

**Happy printing!**
